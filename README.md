**Employee Payroll System**
A simple Java-based console application that models an employee payroll system using object-oriented principles. It supports full-time and part-time employees, calculates their salaries, and manages employee records.

**Features**
Abstract Employee class with polymorphic behavior

Two employee types:

FullTimeEmployee with fixed monthly salary

PartTimeEmployee with hourly rate and hours worked

PayrollSystem class to:

Add and remove employees

Display employee details with calculated salary

Demonstration via Main class

Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8+)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ArrayList for dynamic employee storage

**Project Structure**
Code
EmployeePayrollSystem/
â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java
â”œâ”€â”€ Employee.java
â”œâ”€â”€ FullTimeEmployee.java

java Main

**Sample Output**

ðŸ“š Concepts Demonstrated
Abstraction: Employee is an abstract class with a common interface.

Inheritance: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee extend Employee.

Polymorphism: calculateSalary() is overridden in subclasses.

Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters.

Dynamic Data Management: Employees stored in an ArrayList.
